## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow then Mobile
- Pseudo-element

### What I learned

The ::before and ::after Elements How they work

I faced a little challenge having a background  and a background image for a parent container. Below is a code snippet of how I was able to achieve it.


### Continued development

While working through this project, I noticed I still needed to perfect using JS for mobile navigation toggle. I believe I can make a smoother transition for the mobile navigation toggle. So, I'll be working on that for the next couple of days.
